# easy-transport-system
Nothing special. Just a desktop app that provides London lines and connections based on the London Transport network. Implemented based on Dijkstra's algorithm.

For underlying dataset used for the application (and more), see https://tfl.gov.uk.

Special credit to Amitabha Dey for inspiration on implementing the [Djikstra's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub4-nG09PFw).

Below image shows the graph of the London Transport Network covered by *easy-transport-system*. (This can be automatically generated by the application itself and can be accessed from the menu of the application).

### Using the application
Sadly no massive documentation provided. The application is rather intuitive; hence, a try of the application is your best bet.

To use, simply enter source and destination station. Or select stations from the selection box provided. Then, click the "Take me there" button.

Network graph generator available in the menu. The numbers on the graph represent the station IDs.
